# AMLS_21-22_SN21207190: MRI-Tumor-Detection

1) Project Summary

This project consisted of two tasks:
- Task A: Identify if a tumor is in an MRI scan.
- Task B: Identify if there is a tumor in the MRI scan and if this tumor is a meningioma, glioma or pituitary tumor.
Task A was solved with linear classifiers and the deep learning models in the files:
-> classifier_1_OUT_XDROP.h5
-> classifier_1_OUT.h5
-> classifier_2_OUT_XDROP.h5
-> classifier_2_OUT.h5
-> classifier_2_OUT_100.h5
Task B was solved with the deep learning models in the files
-> classifier_4_OUT_XDROP.h5
-> classifier_4_OUT.h5

2) File organisation in Alphabetical Order
